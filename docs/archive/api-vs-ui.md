# Thunderbird API Objects vs. User Experience

This document explains how the Thunderbird WebExtension API objects map to what users actually see in the application. Understanding this relationship is critical for developing effective extensions that integrate seamlessly with the user's mental model.

## Windows vs. Tabs: API vs. User Perspective

### What Users See:
When using Thunderbird, users typically perceive:
1. **Main Thunderbird window** (folder list, message list, message preview)
2. **Message composition windows** (new emails, replies)
3. **Message display windows** (standalone message viewers)
4. **Extension windows** (like our Copilot popup)

### What the API Reports:
The API shows a more complex structure:
1. **Window objects** - Top-level containers
2. **Tab objects** - Content panes within windows
3. **Mail tab objects** - Specialized tabs for mail folders

## Window Types in Thunderbird

The Thunderbird API reports several window types that map differently to the user experience:

| API Window Type | Description | User Visible? | User Perception |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `normal` | Main Thunderbird window | Yes | The main application window with folders and messages |
| `messageCompose` | Email composition window | Yes | A separate window for writing emails |
| `popup` | Popup window (like extension windows) | Yes | Extension windows, alerts, or dialogs |
| `messageDisplay` | Message viewer window | Yes | A separate window showing a single email |
| (other) | Various internal windows | No | Not directly visible to users |

## Tab Types in Thunderbird

The tab objects in Thunderbird API don't always correspond to what users think of as "tabs":

| API Tab Type | Description | User Perception |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `mail` | Mail folder tab | A tab showing a folder's message list |
| `messageDisplay` | Message viewer tab | A tab showing a single email |
| `messageCompose` | Compose tab | Usually not perceived as a "tab" by users |
| `content` | Web content tab | Extension content or web pages |
| `special` | Special pages tab | Settings, addons, etc. |

## The Disconnect: API Objects vs. User Interface

Understanding the discrepancy between API objects and the user interface:

1. **Windows with Multiple Tabs**:
   - In the API: One window object containing multiple tab objects
   - User perception: One window with multiple tabs

2. **Windows with Single Tabs**:
   - In the API: One window object containing one tab object
   - User perception: Just "a window" (not a window with a tab)

3. **Background/Hidden Windows**:
   - In the API: Window objects with titles like "Mozilla Thunderbird" or blank content
   - User perception: Not visible at all

## Real-world Examples from Debug Data

From your debug log, here's how the objects map to what you actually saw:

### 1. Main Thunderbird Window (Window ID: 1)
- **API Object**: Window of type `normal` with multiple tabs
- **User Perception**: The main Thunderbird window with message folders and emails
- **Tab Types Inside**: `mail`, `special`, `messageDisplay`

### 2. Message Compose Window (Window ID: 571)
- **API Object**: Window of type `messageCompose` with a single tab
- **User Perception**: A separate window for writing an email
- **Title**: "Write: Looking Forward to Future Collaborations - Thunderbird"

### 3. Copilot Extension Window (Window ID: 886)
- **API Object**: Window of type `popup` with a single content tab
- **User Perception**: Our extension's popup window
- **Title**: "Copilot - Mozilla Thunderbird"

### 4. Debug Window (Window ID: 893)
- **API Object**: Window of type `popup` with a single content tab
- **User Perception**: The debug tool window
- **Title**: "Thunder Copilot Debug - Mozilla Thunderbird"

## Phantom/Background Windows

Your debug log shows several window objects that you don't actually see:

- Multiple windows with ID 232, 252, 260, 268, 508, 583, and 599
- All have type `popup` and title "Mozilla Thunderbird"
- All have a single tab with URL "about:blank"

### Characteristics of Phantom Windows

Phantom windows can be identified by the following pattern:
1. Window type: `popup`
2. Window title: "Mozilla Thunderbird" (generic)
3. Contains exactly one tab
4. Tab URL: "about:blank"
5. Not visible to users despite having `popup` type

### Origin of Phantom Windows

These phantom windows are likely:
1. **Extension background pages**: Invisible windows created by extensions
2. **Cached windows**: Windows that haven't been garbage collected
3. **Internal Thunderbird components**: Used for various background functions
4. **Temporary windows**: Created during operations but not fully closed

### How to Handle Phantom Windows

The updated ThunderbirdAPI wrapper provides a function to filter them out:

```javascript
// Only get user-visible windows
const result = await ThunderbirdAPI.windows.getUserVisibleWindows();
console.log(`Found ${result.count} visible windows out of ${result.totalCount} total`);
console.log(`Filtered out ${result.phantomCount} phantom windows`);
```

## Guidelines for Building a Mental Model

When developing for Thunderbird:

1. **Main Window = Multiple Tabs**: The main Thunderbird window contains multiple tab objects
2. **Compose/Display Windows = Window + Tab**: These appear as separate windows to users but are window+tab in the API
3. **Extension Windows = Popup Windows**: Extension UIs are popup windows with content tabs
4. **Ignore Phantom Windows**: Filter out windows with blank content or generic titles

## Using the ThunderbirdAPI Wrapper

The `thunderbird-api.js` wrapper helps bridge the gap between API objects and user expectations:

```javascript
// Getting user-visible windows
const result = await ThunderbirdAPI.windows.getAll({ 
  windowType: 'normal' // Only get main windows
});

// Getting compose windows
const composeWindows = await ThunderbirdAPI.windows.getAll({ 
  windowType: 'messageCompose'
});

// Getting the displayed message in the active tab
const activeEmail = await ThunderbirdAPI.context.getCurrentEmail();
```

## Best Practices for User Experience

1. **Filter Windows By Type**: When looking for specific windows, filter by `type` property
2. **Focus on Titles**: Use window and tab titles to identify user-relevant windows
3. **Check Active Status**: Use `active: true` to find what the user is currently viewing
4. **Understand Tab Types**: Different tab types behave differently for API operations

## API Objects to User Interface Mapping

| API Objects | User Interface |
|-------------|---------------|
| Window (normal) + multiple tabs | Main Thunderbird window with tabs |
| Window (messageCompose) + tab (messageCompose) | Email composition window |
| Window (popup) + tab (content) [extension URL] | Extension popup window |
| Tab (mail) | A mail folder tab |
| Tab (messageDisplay) | An open email tab |
