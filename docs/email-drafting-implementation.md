# Email Drafting Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the email drafting functionality as the first feature of the Thunder Copilot extension. This feature allows users to interact with AI to create professional email drafts that are automatically saved in Thunderbird.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality

1. **AI-Powered Email Generation**: Users can request email drafts through natural language conversation
2. **Structured Draft Parsing**: AI responses are parsed for EMAIL_DRAFT format
3. **Thunderbird Integration**: Drafts are automatically created using the Compose API
4. **Context Awareness**: Supports email and contact context for intelligent drafting

### Architecture

#### Frontend (sidebar.js/sidebar.html)
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Pre-populated prompts for common tasks
- **Context Management**: Add current emails and contacts as context
- **Draft Preview**: Modal preview of generated drafts before creation
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration with structured prompts

#### Backend (background.js)
- **Draft Creation**: Enhanced `createDraft` handler using Compose API
- **Contact Access**: `getContacts` handler for address book integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error management

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Email Draft Creation
```javascript
// AI Response Format
EMAIL_DRAFT:
TO: recipient@example.com
SUBJECT: Meeting Follow-up
BODY:
Thank you for the productive meeting today...
```

#### 2. Context Integration
- **Current Email Context**: Add displayed email for reply/follow-up generation
- **Contacts Context**: Include address book contacts for recipient suggestions
- **Multiple Email Support**: Support for multiple emails in context

#### 3. User Interface Enhancements
- **Quick Actions**: One-click prompts for common tasks
- **Draft Preview**: Preview generated content before creating
- **Visual Context Indicators**: Show what context is currently loaded
- **Seamless Integration**: Native Thunderbird window management

### API Usage

#### Thunderbird WebExtension APIs Used
1. **`browser.compose.beginNew()`** - Create new compose window
2. **`browser.compose.saveMessage()`** - Save draft to Thunderbird
3. **`browser.addressBooks.list()`** - Get available address books
4. **`browser.contacts.list()`** - Get contacts from address books
5. **`browser.messageDisplay.getDisplayedMessage()`** - Get current email context

#### Required Permissions
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "compose",
    "compose.save",
    "addressBooks",
    "messagesRead",
    "accountsRead"
  ]
}
```

### User Workflow

1. **Context Addition** (Optional)
   - Click "Add context" → "Current email" to analyze displayed email
   - Click "Add context" → "My contacts" to load address book

2. **Draft Request**
   - Use quick action "✉️ Draft Email" or type custom request
   - AI generates structured email draft

3. **Preview & Create**
   - Preview generated draft in modal
   - Click "Create Draft" to save in Thunderbird
   - Draft opens in new compose window

### Error Handling

- **API Key Validation**: Check for OpenAI API key before requests
- **Permission Checks**: Validate required Thunderbird permissions
- **Network Error Recovery**: Handle API failures gracefully
- **Context Validation**: Verify email/contact data before processing

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Contacts loaded only when requested
- **Context Limits**: Email bodies limited to 2000 characters for context
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient address book scanning
- **Memory Management**: Context cleared when not needed

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Draft Creation**
   - Request: "Draft an email to john@example.com about our meeting"
   - Expected: Compose window opens with pre-filled recipient and content

2. **Context-Aware Drafting**
   - Add current email to context
   - Request: "Reply to this email"
   - Expected: Draft generated based on original email content

3. **Contact Integration**
   - Add contacts to context
   - Request: "Draft email to my team about the project update"
   - Expected: AI suggests recipients from contact list

### Known Limitations

1. **Email Parsing**: Complex email formats may not parse perfectly
2. **Contact Matching**: AI contact matching based on names/emails only
3. **Draft Formatting**: Limited rich text formatting support
4. **API Dependencies**: Requires OpenAI API key for functionality

### Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Text Support**: HTML email formatting
2. **Template System**: Pre-defined email templates
3. **Signature Integration**: Automatic signature insertion
4. **Attachment Handling**: AI-suggested attachments
5. **Send Scheduling**: Schedule draft sending

## Code Structure

### Key Files Modified

- `sidebar.js`: Enhanced AI interaction and draft creation UI
- `sidebar.html`: Added quick actions and context management
- `background.js`: Improved draft creation and contact access
- `manifest.json`: Already had required permissions

### New Functions Added

1. `parseEmailDraft()`: Parse AI responses for email structure
2. `addDraftActions()`: Add creation/preview buttons
3. `showDraftPreview()`: Modal preview functionality
4. `getContacts()`: Background script contact handler

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Draft
```
User: "Draft a professional email to sarah@company.com asking about the quarterly report"

AI Response:
EMAIL_DRAFT:
TO: sarah@company.com
SUBJECT: Quarterly Report Inquiry
BODY:
Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the quarterly report that was mentioned in our previous discussion.

Could you please provide an update on the current status and expected timeline for completion?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards
```

### Example 2: Context-Aware Reply
```
Context: Current email from boss about project deadline

User: "Reply to this email confirming I can meet the deadline"

AI Response:
EMAIL_DRAFT:
TO: boss@company.com
SUBJECT: Re: Project Deadline Confirmation
BODY:
Dear [Boss Name],

Thank you for your email regarding the project deadline.

I can confirm that I will be able to meet the proposed deadline of [date]. I have reviewed my current workload and allocated sufficient time to ensure timely completion.

I will keep you updated on progress and reach out if any issues arise.

Best regards
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for AI-powered email drafting while maintaining integration with Thunderbird's native email management system.
