# Text Selection Context Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the text selection context functionality as the second major feature of the Thunder Copilot extension. This feature allows users to select text from any Thunderbird window and use it as context for AI operations.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality

1. **Cross-Window Text Selection**: Capture selected text from any active Thunderbird tab
2. **Context Extraction**: Automatically extract surrounding context for better understanding
3. **Multi-Selection Support**: Support for multiple text selections as context
4. **Source Tracking**: Track which window/document the selection came from

### Architecture

#### Frontend Integration (sidebar.js/sidebar.html)
- **Context Dropdown Option**: "Selected text" option in context menu
- **Quick Action Button**: "üîç Analyze Selection" for immediate text analysis
- **Context Management**: Integrated with existing email and contact context system
- **Visual Indicators**: Updated context counter to show selections

#### Script Execution (tabs.executeScript)
- **Selection Detection**: Uses `window.getSelection()` to capture selected text
- **Context Analysis**: Extracts surrounding paragraph/container content
- **Source Information**: Captures document title and location info
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when no text is selected

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Text Selection Capture
```javascript
// Execute script in active tab to get selection
const results = await browser.tabs.executeScript(activeTab.id, {
  code: `
    (function() {
      const selection = window.getSelection();
      const selectedText = selection.toString().trim();
      
      if (!selectedText) {
        return { success: false, error: 'No text selected' };
      }
      
      // Extract context around selection...
      return {
        success: true,
        selectedText: selectedText,
        contextText: contextInfo,
        source: document.title || 'Unknown source'
      };
    })();
  `
});
```

#### 2. Context Integration
- **Selection Storage**: Array-based storage for multiple selections
- **Context Aggregation**: Combine selections with emails and contacts
- **AI Prompt Building**: Include selections in AI context with source attribution

#### 3. User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages for selection capture
- **Context Display**: Show selection count in context indicator
- **Source Attribution**: Display which document/window selection came from

### API Usage

#### Thunderbird WebExtension APIs Used
1. **`browser.tabs.query()`** - Get active tab for script execution
2. **`browser.tabs.executeScript()`** - Execute selection detection in active tab
3. **`window.getSelection()`** - Browser API for text selection (in content script)

#### Required Permissions Added
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "activeTab"
  ]
}
```

### User Workflow

1. **Text Selection**
   - User selects text in any Thunderbird window (email, compose, etc.)

2. **Context Addition**
   - Click "Add context" ‚Üí "Selected text" to capture selection
   - Or use quick action "üîç Analyze Selection"

3. **AI Interaction**
   - Selected text becomes part of conversation context
   - AI can reference and analyze the selected content

### Selection Data Structure

```javascript
const selectionData = {
  id: Date.now(),                    // Unique identifier
  text: "Selected text content",     // The actual selected text
  context: "Surrounding paragraph...", // Context around selection
  source: "Document Title",          // Source window/document
  timestamp: "2025-09-30T..."        // When selection was captured
};
```

### Context Processing

#### For AI Prompts
```
Here are text selections for reference:

--- Selection 1 ---
Source: Meeting Notes - Thunderbird
Selected text: Q4 budget planning meeting scheduled for next week
Context: The quarterly review showed positive growth. Q4 budget planning meeting scheduled for next week. We need to finalize the proposals by Friday.

--- End of text selections ---
```

### Error Handling

- **No Selection**: Clear message when no text is selected
- **Script Injection Failure**: Graceful fallback with error messages
- **Permission Issues**: Proper error reporting for tab access
- **Cross-Tab Compatibility**: Works across different Thunderbird tab types

### Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight Execution**: Minimal script injection for selection detection
- **Context Limits**: Surrounding context limited to 500 characters
- **Memory Management**: Selections stored with timestamps for potential cleanup
- **Tab Access**: Only executes on active tab when requested

### Browser Compatibility

- **Thunderbird-Specific**: Designed for Thunderbird's tab system
- **Cross-Window Support**: Works in mail tabs, compose windows, message display
- **Selection API**: Uses standard DOM Selection API for maximum compatibility

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Email Content Selection**
   - Select text from displayed email
   - Verify context includes surrounding email content

2. **Compose Window Selection**
   - Select text while composing email
   - Ensure selection works in compose environment

3. **Multiple Selections**
   - Add multiple text selections as context
   - Verify all selections appear in AI prompts

4. **No Selection Edge Case**
   - Try to capture when no text is selected
   - Verify appropriate error message

### Known Limitations

1. **Tab-Specific**: Only works on currently active tab
2. **Selection Persistence**: Selections don't persist across browser restarts
3. **Rich Text**: Captures plain text only, not formatting
4. **Large Selections**: Very large selections might be truncated

### Integration with Existing Features

#### Email Drafting Enhancement
- Use selected text as basis for email content
- Reference selected information in draft generation

#### Context Aggregation
- Combine with email context for comprehensive analysis
- Include contact information for recipient suggestions

### Future Enhancements

1. **Selection History**: Persistent storage of selections
2. **Rich Text Support**: Preserve formatting in selections
3. **Auto-Selection**: Automatically capture selections when made
4. **Batch Selection**: Select multiple non-contiguous text portions
5. **Selection Annotation**: Add user notes to selections

## Code Structure

### Key Files Modified

- `sidebar.js`: Added text selection capture and context integration
- `sidebar.html`: Added context dropdown option and quick action button
- `manifest.json`: Added required tabs and activeTab permissions

### New Functions Added

1. `addTextSelectionBtn.addEventListener()`: Main selection capture handler
2. Enhanced `updateContextUI()`: Include selection count in context display
3. Enhanced `sendMessage()`: Include selections in AI context building

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Email Analysis
```
1. User selects important paragraph from email
2. Adds selection to context via dropdown
3. Asks: "What are the key action items from this text?"
4. AI analyzes the selected content with full context
```

### Example 2: Draft Enhancement
```
1. User selects meeting notes from email
2. Adds selection to context
3. Uses quick action: "Draft a professional email"
4. AI creates email referencing the selected information
```

### Example 3: Multi-Source Analysis
```
1. User selects text from multiple emails
2. Adds each selection to context
3. Asks: "Compare the approaches mentioned in these selections"
4. AI analyzes across all selected content
```

This implementation provides a powerful way to give AI context from any text content visible in Thunderbird, significantly enhancing the contextual awareness of the Copilot system.
